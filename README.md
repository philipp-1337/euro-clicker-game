## How to Play

1. **Basic Principle**: Click on the buttons to earn money. Each button has its own value and cooldown time.

2. **Managers**: Once you have enough money, you can buy managers who will automatically click for you. Each manager is associated with a specific button.

3. **Upgrades**:
   - **Value Upgrades**: Increase the money value of the respective button by 10%
   - **Time Upgrades**: Reduce the cooldown time of the respective button by 10%

4. **Strategy**: Decide wisely when to invest in managers or upgrades to maximize your money growth!

## Customization

You can easily customize the game by changing the values and prices in the code:

- Modify the base values and cooldown times in the `baseButtons` array
- Adjust the manager and upgrade costs
- Add more button types or change their colors
